## 3D living room scene with user navigation, textures, and lighting.
**Written in:** C++, OpenGL 4.4  
**Libraries:** GLFW, GLEW, GLAD, glm. (PDF attached to provide assistance. Developed by SNHU)  
**Software:** Visual Studios 2019 (To change the VS version locally, see same PDF for setting up OpenGL)  
**Contributors:** Katie Stapleton
**Origin:** basic templates accreditted to SNHU's CS-330 course tutorials on computational graphics and visualization. 
**Date**: 07/2021
  
*A zipped packge of the repo is available in the review branch. Execution file is not included due to unresolved issue. Review is needed by another developer. Folder is added to main containing screenshots of the 3D scene from different views (folder: 3d-living room images).*  
  
**Approach, Development, and Short Reflection**  
I developed this project first by analyzing what requirements needed to be meet. I mapped out the basic functions needed to initialize the project. I built upon each MVP until all requirements were satisfied. The coding was testing frequently with issues addressed as they arose. I review sources such as the OpenGL documentation, GLFW documentation, stack overflow, videos, websites, and sought out help (even though it was highly limited). This project improved my skills and showed me why modularity is essential in computer programming. I struggled with developing reusable functions at the beginning; at a later point, I developed and incorporated my own reusable custom functions into the project. The source code still seems crowded to me, but I plan to separate similar function groups into separate files and use constructors to call upon the methods, such as using constructors to call on a shader in the shader header file. Though I see definitely areas for improvement, I am still proud of what I have accomplished in this project.The computer graphics project provided me the experience of understanding how C++ can be combined with other languages, interfaces, and graphics libraries. I gained skills in reviewing and adapting QA to fit my project including with different interfaces and libraries.
